// ============================================================
// Public base URL for links we hand out (team invite links, partner
// invitation emails). Extracted from /api/account/invitations so
// every invite surface shares one hardened resolver.
// ============================================================

// Resolve the base URL we publish invite links under.
//
// Resolution order, first match wins:
//
//   1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — admin's explicit config. Trumps
//      everything; if you set this, that's where links point.
//   2. `X-Forwarded-Host` (+ `X-Forwarded-Proto`) — set by every
//      reverse proxy in front of the app: Hostinger Managed
//      Node.js, Vercel, Cloudflare, nginx. This is what makes
//      invite links Just Work in production without forcing the
//      operator to set an env var.
//   3. `Host` header + the protocol the request arrived on —
//      bare deployments without a proxy.
//   4. Last-resort marketing-site fallback. Only hit if the
//      request has no Host header at all, which is essentially
//      impossible from a real browser. Logs a warning so the
//      operator can spot the misconfig.
//
// Defense-in-depth: `ALLOWED_INVITE_HOSTS`
//
//   The request-header path (#2 and #3 above) trusts whatever
//   hostname the client (or proxy) puts in the header. On a
//   typical proxied deploy (Vercel / Hostinger / Cloudflare) the
//   proxy overwrites these so they're trustworthy. On a bare
//   deployment exposed to the public internet, an attacker could
//   POST directly with a crafted `Host: phishing.example` and
//   receive an invite URL pointing at their site.
//
//   When `ALLOWED_INVITE_HOSTS` is set (comma-separated hostnames),
//   we validate the derived host against the list. Anything not
//   on the list falls through to the wacrm.tech fallback with a
//   loud console.warn. Operators who care about this attack
//   surface should set this to their canonical hostnames; everyone
//   else gets today's permissive behavior.
//
// Previous implementation hard-defaulted to `https://wacrm.tech`
// (the docs/marketing site, a different repo). Forks that didn't
// set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` got invite links pointing at the
// marketing site, which 404s on `/join/<token>`. This resolution
// chain removes the foot-gun.
